Week 7 Lab
========================================================

Class projects
-----------------
For lab this week, we will break into our groups to go over our projects. Taking turns, I would like you guys to share the code that you have already and any preliminary results. Once you have discussed all the projects, spend the rest of the time working on your projects in your breakout group. I will cycle through the different rooms to answer any questions or advice as needed. Otherwise, you have this time to develop your code with the goal of getting a simple version of the model running before the end of lab.

We will return to these groups in a couple weeks for another work session, where you can hopefully share some prelimiary results with your team mates and discuss additional modifications or changes to the original model.
