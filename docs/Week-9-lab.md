Week 9 Lab
========================================================

This week, we're going to spend our lab time together working on our projects, and thinking about how/if to use a hierarchical modeling structure. If spatial or phylogenetic structure is going to be important, now is a good time to work out how to do that. By the end of this week, you should be well on your way with your project, with the data sorted and an initial model running in JAGS.
